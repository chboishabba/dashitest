## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated research and development environment for building and testing an "epistemic control system" for financial trading. The core idea is to move beyond simple predictive models and instead create a system that understands the "game" of the market, including when to trade, when to hold, and when the market is behaving pathologically.

The project is built primarily in Python, with a focus on high-performance computing and a unique "triadic" logic that underpins the entire system. It also includes explorations into using JAX and Vulkan for accelerated computations.

The project is organized into two main tracks:

1.  **Production Trading System:** A mature, functional trading simulator that implements the core triadic control loop. This system can backtest strategies on historical market data and provide detailed performance analytics.
2.  **Cellular Automata (CA) Research:** A set of experimental, standalone scripts that explore the use of Cellular Automata for modeling complex systems. This research is not yet integrated into the main trading system but serves as a laboratory for developing new ideas about market dynamics and information theory.

The project also contains a significant amount of theoretical work on machine learning, particularly on the phenomenon of "grokking" and a novel "kernel math" for general learning.

## Building and Running

The project is a collection of Python scripts and modules, and does not have a single "build" process. The key scripts are run directly from the command line.

### Running the Trading Simulator

The main trading simulator can be run using the `trading/run_trader.py` script. To run a simulation on BTC data, you can use:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python trading/scripts/run_bars_btc.py
```

To run simulations across all available markets, use the `trading/run_all_two_pointO.py` script:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python trading/run_all_two_pointO.py --markets
```

### Viewing the Trading Dashboard

The project includes a live dashboard for visualizing the results of trading simulations. To run it, point it at a log file generated by the simulator:

```bash
python trading/training_dashboard.py --log logs/trading_log.csv
```

### Running Benchmarks

The project includes a number of benchmarks for testing the performance of different components. The main benchmark driver is `dashitest.py`:

```bash
python dashitest.py
```

## Development Conventions

The codebase follows a set of conventions that should be adhered to when making changes.

*   **Triadic Logic:** The core of the system is based on triadic logic, using the values `{-1, 0, +1}` to represent states. This is a fundamental concept and should be used consistently.
*   **Epistemic Gating:** The system separates "permission" (whether to act) from "prediction" (what to do). This is a key architectural principle.
*   **Fish-Safe Commands:** Scripts should be "fish-safe," meaning they can be run without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The trading system and the CA research are kept in separate directories and are not integrated. This separation should be maintained.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** The `README.md` and `CONTEXT.md` files provide a wealth of information about the project. These should be kept up-to-date.
*   **Python-centric:** The project is primarily written in Python. New code should also be in Python unless there is a compelling reason to use another language.

## Agent Skills and Conventions

This section documents the skills and conventions of the AI agent assisting with this project.

### The `get-shit-done` Skill

This is a meta-skill for organizing and executing complex tasks. It involves:

1.  **Planning:** Breaking down a high-level goal into a series of concrete, verifiable steps.
2.  **Execution:** Systematically working through the plan, using available tools to inspect code, read documentation, and run commands.
3.  **Summarization:** Producing a clear, concise summary of the findings, often referencing specific files and line numbers.

This skill was used to inspect the Vulkan compute shader implementation, identify the key files (`vulkan_compute/compute_buffer.py`, `vulkan_compute/shaders/add.comp`), and document the steps needed to run it.

### Other Skills and Notes

*   **Conversation Viewing:** The agent can be asked to view the contents of other conversations.
*   **Searching Outputs:** The agent can use `rg` (ripgrep) to search the output of other commands or skills.
*   **Live Documentation:** The agent should update documentation (like this file) as it learns new things about the project or its own capabilities.
*   **Further Skills:** More skills may be available and documented in `~/.codex`.
