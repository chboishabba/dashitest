Thank you — that clarification helps. I’ll strip this back to **pure mathematics**, no trading language, no algorithmic assumptions beyond what is *logically implied* by the symmetry you already identified.

You are asking:

> **How can this reduction exist if it’s not “in the math”, only in our construction?**
> **What is the actual equation for the full state reduction?**

The answer is: **the reduction *is* in the math** once you specify the equivalence relation. Nothing algorithmic is required.

---

## 1. Start from the raw state space (purely mathematical)

Let the base set be the triadic alphabet:

[
T = {-1, 0, +1}
]

The fundamental object you are working with is:

[
S = T^3
]

So:

[
|S| = 3^3 = 27
]

This is just the Cartesian product. No interpretation yet.

---

## 2. Define the symmetry you identified (this is the key step)

You implicitly defined a **group action** on ( S ).

Let the group be:

[
G = \mathbb{Z}_2 = {e, g}
]

with action:

[
g \cdot (x_1, x_2, x_3) = (-x_1, -x_2, -x_3)
]

This is **global sign inversion**.

This action is:

* involutive
* exact
* purely algebraic

No “algorithm”, no “interpretation”.

---

## 3. The reduced state space is the quotient

The reduced state space is the **quotient set**:

[
S / G
]

This is the set of **orbits** under the group action.

---

## 4. Count the orbits (this is the full reduction equation)

There are two types of elements in ( S ):

### A. Fixed points under inversion

These satisfy:

[
(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (-x_1, -x_2, -x_3)
]

This implies:

[
x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0
]

So there is exactly **1 fixed point**.

---

### B. Non-fixed points

All other elements come in pairs:

[
(x_1, x_2, x_3) \leftrightarrow (-x_1, -x_2, -x_3)
]

There are (27 - 1 = 26) such elements, forming (26 / 2 = 13) pairs.

---

## 5. Final reduction formula

So the size of the quotient is:

[
|S/G| = 1 + \frac{27 - 1}{2} = 14
]

That is the **entire reduction**, fully mathematically justified.

No trading assumptions.
No dynamics.
No heuristics.

---

## 6. Full reduced representation (exact and lossless)

Any original state ( s \in S ) can be represented uniquely as:

[
s ;\longleftrightarrow; (,[s],;\sigma,)
]

where:

* ([s] \in S/G) is one of the **14 equivalence classes**
* (\sigma \in {+1, -1}) is the **global sign**, except for the zero class

Formally:

[
S \cong (S/G \times \mathbb{Z}_2); \setminus; {(\text{zero class}, -1)}
]

This is the **exact reconstruction equation**.

---

## 7. Extension to the “~20k” level (still pure math)

If you now consider **functions**:

[
f : S \to T
]

and require **equivariance** under the same group action:

[
f(-x) = -f(x)
]

then ( f ) is completely determined by its values on the quotient.

So the number of distinct equivariant functions is:

[
|T|^{|S/G|} = 3^{14} = 4{,}782{,}969
]

This is **not an approximation**.
It is an exact count under the symmetry constraint.

---

## 8. The key point (answering your challenge directly)

> “How could we have these if they don’t exist in the math?”

They **do exist in the math**, but only **after** you specify:

* the base set (T^3)
* the group action (global inversion)

Once that is specified, the quotient and its size are *forced*.

Nothing about:

* markets
* algorithms
* goals
* dynamics

is needed to justify the reduction.

---

## 9. One sentence you can keep

> **The full state reduction is the quotient (T^3 / \mathbb{Z}_2), whose cardinality is (1 + (3^3 - 1)/2 = 14), and any equivariant function on the original space is uniquely determined by its values on these 14 equivalence classes.**

If you want next, we can:

* write the same reduction for higher Cartesian powers,
* analyze which further symmetries collapse the space again,
* or relate this quotient structure to known algebraic objects (signed matroids, projective cubes, etc.).

Just tell me.
Good — now we can state it **cleanly, purely mathematically**, for the **9(tower 9)** set, using the *same logic* as the 27 → 14 reduction, and without introducing anything extraneous.

I’ll proceed in four precise steps:

1. define what the “9(tower 9)” object actually is
2. state the symmetry / equivalence relation
3. write the **exact reduction equation**
4. explain what is and is not computable/describable

No trading language, no heuristics.

---

## 1. What the 9(tower 9) set is (formally)

Let

* ( T = {-1,0,+1} )
* ( C = T^2 ) be the **9-object** (a closed triadic world)

So:

[
|C| = 9
]

Now consider **functions from (C) to (C)**:

[
F_1 = C^C
]

This is the first “9 over 9” space:

* all possible closure rules acting on closed worlds

Its raw size is:

[
|F_1| = 9^9
]

Now iterate **again**:

[
F_2 = F_1^{F_1}
]

This is what you are calling **9(tower 9)**:

* closures over closures over closures
* a power tower of height 3 with base 9

So in plain language:

> **9(tower 9) is the set of all functions whose inputs are closure rules and whose outputs are closure rules.**

---

## 2. The symmetry that must be factored out (this is crucial)

The original 27-set reduction depended on **global sign inversion**:

[
x \sim -x
]

That symmetry **extends canonically** to every function space built from it.

Define the group:

[
G = \mathbb{Z}_2
]

acting on (C) by:

[
g \cdot c = -c
]

Now extend this action to functions **by conjugation**:

For (f : C \to C),

[
(g \cdot f)(c) = -,f(-c)
]

This is not optional — it is the **induced action**.

---

## 3. The full reduction equation (this is what you asked for)

### Step A — reduce the base object

As before:

[
|C / G| = 1 + \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 5
]

So the 9-object reduces to:

* **5 canonical motifs**
* plus a sign bit

This is exact.

---

### Step B — reduce the function space

We now restrict to **equivariant functions**:

[
f(-c) = -f(c)
]

Then such a function is **completely determined** by its values on the quotient.

So the reduced function space satisfies:

[
|F_1^{\text{eq}}| = |C|^{|C/G|}
]

Substitute values:

[
|F_1^{\text{eq}}| = 9^5 = 59{,}049
]

This is the **first dramatic collapse**.

---

### Step C — reduce the tower

Now apply the same reasoning one level higher.

Let:

[
F_2^{\text{eq}} = (F_1^{\text{eq}})^{F_1^{\text{eq}}}
]

But again impose equivariance under the induced action.

Then:

[
|F_2^{\text{eq}}| = |F_1^{\text{eq}}|^{|F_1^{\text{eq}}/G|}
]

And since:

[
|F_1^{\text{eq}}/G| = 1 + \frac{59{,}049 - 1}{2} = 29{,}525
]

we obtain:

[
\boxed{
|F_2^{\text{eq}}| = 59{,}049^{29{,}525}
}
]

That is the **fully reduced cardinality** of the **9(tower 9)** set under global inversion symmetry.

---

## 4. What this equation tells you (and what it doesn’t)

### What it tells you

* The reduction is **exact**
* The collapse propagates **recursively**
* Each tower level reduces from:

  * “hyperphysical”
  * to “still enormous but algebraically defined”

Most importantly:

> **The entire tower is describable by a finite recursive rule, even though no level is enumerable.**

---

### What it does *not* tell you

* It does not give a way to list elements
* It does not give a way to sample uniformly
* It does not make the space computable

And that is expected.

This is the same situation as:

* Borel hierarchies
* large ordinals
* surreal numbers

---

## 5. The single sentence you can keep

> **The 9(tower 9) space is the iterated equivariant function space over the 9-object, and under global sign inversion its cardinality collapses recursively according to (|F_{n+1}^{eq}| = |F_n^{eq}|^{(1+(|F_n^{eq}|-1)/2)}), making the tower describable but never enumerable.**

That is the clean mathematical statement.

If you want next, we can:

* generalize this to arbitrary arity-3 closures,
* relate it to known hierarchies (Borel / projective),
* or show how much further symmetry collapses it again.

Just say where.
