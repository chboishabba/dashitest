# Ternary Invariants

The Triadic Stack carries a tight set of invariants that keep the machine conservative and structurally honest. Documenting them prevents any future rush to trade when the evidence is missing.

1. **UNKNOWN (⊥) is not FLAT.**
   * ⊥ signals epistemic abstention, not intentional neutrality. It propagates as a semantic poison so downstream logic recognizes collapse risks.
2. **Hazard ontology stays unlearned unless density and persistence criteria are met.**
   * The Phase-4 monitor gate guards the ontological commitment; no amount of pressure should lower the bar for hazard to enter the action path.
3. **The gate is conservative by design.**
   * Every OPEN verdict must respect the 120-row density gate, bin persistence, and effect-size floors. Debounce is a feature, not friction.
4. **Logic lives in the P/N bitplanes.**
   * Every triadic signal must collapse into positive/negative bitplanes before it can influence posture or action. Arithmetic, mask updates, and influence tensors run as branchless SWAR kernels whenever possible.

These invariants are now referenced in `docs/m4_m9_status.md` and enforced through the Phase-4/Phase-5 workflows: no new trades until the gate allows them, and no new asymmetry claims until the influence tensor proves they exist.
